# Nashville Data Cleaning 
## Goals SQL Queries
* Use CONVERT to standardize the date format.
* Use the JOIN and IS NULL functions to populate property address data that is NULL.
* Using SUBSTRING and break out Address into Individual Columns (Address, City, State) in order to make the data more usable for analysis.
* Using a CASE statement Clean the Sold As Vacant field by converting Y and N rows with YES and NO. 
* Using ROW NUMBER, PARTITION BY AND A CTE I remove duplicate rows.
* Finally I delete unused columns that would not be useful during analysis.
